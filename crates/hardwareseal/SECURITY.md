# Security model

## Scope

`hardwareseal` protects short secrets at rest by binding them to one device. It
defends against copying a sealed envelope to another device and against
store-now/decrypt-later attacks on an asymmetric wrapping scheme.

After a successful unseal, the caller receives the plaintext in process memory.
The crate cannot protect that plaintext from a compromised process, kernel, or
debugger. Callers should keep the returned `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` alive for as
little time as possible.

Internally, every buffer that can hold cleartext is wiped rather than merely
freed: the assembled TPM command, the transport response buffer, and each
intermediate copy taken from it.

## Cryptography

- Linux and non-biometric Windows policies create TPM 2.0 sealed-data objects
  beneath an AES-256-CFB restricted storage primary. SHA-256 names TPM objects
  and binds their public parameters.
- Windows biometric policies first create a TPM sealed-data object, then wrap
  that object with AES-256-GCM under a platform WebAuthn credential's 256-bit
  PRF output. Unsealing requires both Windows Hello user verification and the
  original physical TPM.
- Android creates a non-exportable AES-256-GCM key in Android Keystore, rejects
  keys whose `KeyInfo` reports software-only storage, and authenticates the
  envelope metadata as associated data.
- Apple stores the short secret as a device-only Data Protection Keychain item.
  Each seal writes its own item under a random identifier that the envelope
  carries, so an envelope always names the one secret it was created for. With
  the biometric policy, `biometryCurrentSet` gates every retrieval and
  invalidates the item when biometric enrollment changes.

`hardwareseal` does not use public-key encryption to wrap the secret. The
Windows Hello credential and WebAuthn protocol
may internally use classical public-key cryptography, so the complete Windows
biometric path is not claimed to be post-quantum certified. Its stored secret
envelope is encrypted with a credential-bound symmetric PRF output.

## Fail-closed rules

- Unsupported backends and policies return an error.
- Linux requires `/dev/tpmrm0`; it does not fall back to an unmediated TPM
  device or a software simulator. A device that is absent, unreadable by this
  process, or held by another one reports `Error::NotAvailable`, so a caller
  sees the same structured outcome as a machine with no TPM instead of an
  opaque device error.
- Windows releases the TPM storage hierarchy authorization only to
  administrators. When TBS refuses it, TPM sealing uses the empty
  authorization Windows keeps by default; the storage primary comes from the
  hierarchy seed, not this value, so both paths derive the same key. A
  refused authorization is reported as an error. Hierarchy authorization is
  outside the TPM's dictionary-attack lockout, so the attempt cannot lock the
  TPM.
- Windows rejects the explicit TBS emulator interface for TPM sealing and
  requires a user-verifying platform authenticator with PRF support for the
  biometric policy. It uses standard WebAuthn PRF input transformation, fresh
  per-envelope inputs, an application-owned prompt window, a bounded timeout,
  and validates the assertion's RP-ID hash, user-presence bit, and
  user-verification bit.
- Android rejects software-only Keystore keys.
- Envelopes bind their backend version, access policy, and SHA-256 label hash.
- Biometric authentication is never simulated with a separate, unbound prompt.
- Native cancellation, denial, unavailable UI/session, and credential
  invalidation are typed authorization outcomes. Unknown native failures stay
  generic and never become authorization success.

Linux and Android currently reject the biometric policy where the native
operation cannot yet bind a cryptographic factor to each unseal.

## Compliance

AES-256 and SHA-256 are commonly permitted by regulated cryptographic profiles,
but algorithm choice is not a validation. FIPS status depends on the exact TPM,
operating-system cryptographic module, device configuration, build, and product
boundary. This crate must not be described as FIPS validated without an
applicable certificate and deployment-specific assessment.
