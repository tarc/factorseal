#       there: Desktop, and the CLI with its helpers and SecretSpec provider.
#       Refuses to start while Desktop or the CLI runs, since Windows locks
#       their executables.
#   build-windows.sh check [--broker]
#       Mirror, then run clippy and Desktop's tests natively. Leaves the
#       release executables alone, so it can run while Desktop is open.
#   --broker also cross-compiles the WSL broker on the WSL side.
#
# Desktop cannot be cross-compiled (its renderer needs Windows' shader
# compiler), so the Windows copy is built in place through interop. The copy
# defaults to %USERPROFILE%\Projects\factorseal; override it with
# FACTORSEAL_WINDOWS_TREE (a WSL path).
