# Windows Desktop checks from WSL2

Read `scripts/windows-desktop-check/README.md` first; it describes every
script, the flow, and the pitfalls. This file is the order of work.

## Build

- `./scripts/windows-desktop-check/build-windows.sh check` for clippy and
  Desktop's tests natively (safe while Desktop runs).
- `./scripts/windows-desktop-check/build-windows.sh --broker` for release
  binaries. If it refuses because Desktop is running, ask the user to quit
  Desktop from its tray icon, then rerun.
- Never try to cross-compile Desktop from WSL; its renderer needs Windows.

## Check the approval popup

The user must do the steps only a person can. Give them the exact commands,
say which shell they run in, and wait for them.

Without the user, use the test vault: `check.sh test-desktop`, then
`check.sh popup --test-vault --then grant` (or `--then deny`, which does not
yet deny in the vault). The driver takes over the pointer for a few seconds,
so say so first. Against the user's own vault:

1. Ask the user to start Desktop and unlock the vault, from a normal
   PowerShell: `cd <windows copy>; .\target\release\factorseal-desktop.exe`
2. Run `./scripts/windows-desktop-check/check.sh popup` (or `--delay 10` and
   ask them to bring another app to the front, for the "behind" case). Tell
   them to leave the popup alone until the result prints.
3. Read `popup.png` and `taskbar.png` from the printed paths yourself instead
   of asking for screenshots.
4. Ask the user to approve (or deny). After approving, run
   `check.sh grant --key <key from step 2>`.

If `check.sh` says the vault is sealed, ask the user to unlock and rerun
promptly; it seals itself after a few idle minutes.

## Inspect

- UI Automation: `uia-dump.ps1 -Out <file> [-DesktopPid <pid>]`. From WSL it
  sees only window frames if Desktop was started elevated.
- Hangs or crashes: start `proc-watch.ps1 -Out <file> -Seconds 600` from WSL
  in the background before the user launches Desktop, and ask them to set
  `$env:FACTORSEAL_TIMINGS = '1'` and redirect stderr to a file.

## Rules

- A change to Desktop's UI is committed only after it was seen working in a
  native Windows build.
- Report what the scripts measured (pass/fail lines, screenshots, grant
  lifetime); do not infer popup behavior from code alone.
