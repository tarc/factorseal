# Security

Factorseal is an unaudited prototype. Do not use it for production secrets
until its native Linux, macOS, and Windows acceptance suites pass and an
independent review has been completed. The remaining checks are tracked in the
[security release gates](acceptance/security-release-gates.md).

Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers. Do not
open a public issue before a coordinated fix is available.

## Vault security boundary

The per-user vault is the intended product architecture. Its keyring interface
is one authorized way to retrieve and update credentials:

- one per-user process is the sole owner of the embedded Turso database, the
  lease-scoped installation root/index capability, and active operation keys;
- every document generation has an independent random DEK; its current-record
  snapshot and separate value-free history are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and
  authenticated by one commit signed by the installation's device key;
- secret names and values exist inside encrypted documents, not plaintext SQL
  columns or filenames;
- the vault root directory is created mode 0700 on Unix and with a protected,
  owner-only DACL on Windows, and both are re-validated every time the vault
  is opened;
- project and address enumeration requires a separate authenticated `List`
  grant, is available only while unsealed, and never returns secret values;
- a bounded local protocol authorizes transport-derived user, executable, and
  application identities against durable scoped grants;
- duplicated and oversized requests fail closed, and secret buffers use
  zeroizing storage where the API permits;
- idle and absolute unseal leases, explicit sealing, termination signals, startup
  cleanup, native suspend/shutdown/session notifications, and live expiration
  all converge on the same store shutdown path.

Desktop launches the CLI's dedicated `desktop-worker` as the key owner. The
worker hardens its process before reading a bounded bootstrap over inherited
pipes. The password is wiped after create/unseal, before database ownership or
service startup. Desktop uses authenticated native IPC for subsequent requests;
it does not retain the installation root or an unlock password during the lease.
Closing its lifeline (including Desktop exit/crash) seals and terminates the
worker, with a four-second emergency exit if teardown blocks. Native lifecycle
and lease monitors also run in that worker. The CLI must be installed alongside
Desktop or selected through `FACTORSEAL_CLI_EXECUTABLE`.

On Linux, Secret Service item labels and lookup attributes stay in the encrypted
vault index. Desktop drops that index on seal and does not persist a plaintext
search cache. Credential lookups while sealed return `IsLocked` immediately;
users must manually unlock Desktop before applications can look up credentials.
Clients that explicitly request `Unlock` can still use the normal prompt flow.

Desktop secret-entry fields use bounded locked, guarded buffers, omit undo/copy
history, and send only masked text to the renderer. Submitting, leaving a secret
view, or sealing clears the inputs. Clipboard, native input methods, crypto
libraries, and operating-system internals can still hold copies; this is not a
claim of comprehensive memory erasure.

Every unlock group is hardware-bound. Factors inside a group are AND
requirements and independently wrapped groups are OR alternatives. Password
groups use memory-hard Argon2id by default. The opt-in FIPS profile instead
uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 with 600,000 iterations. Both encrypt the installation
root with AES-256-GCM before one hardware key per group wraps it. The root
derives the document-index key and authenticates the wrapped signing capability and
each generation's independently wrapped DEK.
Biometric groups gate their hardware keys with the platform biometric policy;
biometric-only groups do not contain a password layer. Password files are
accepted only as private
bounded regular files and are intended for short-lived session launch handoff.
The same open handle is checked and read. Unix requires current-user ownership,
no group/other access, and no final symlink; Windows rejects final reparse points
and requires a current-user-owned file without ACL grants to another account.
Export files are created privately before any bytes are written, then atomically
replace the destination: mode 0600 on Unix and a protected current-user-only
DACL on Windows, even in a shared destination directory.

All public vault-creation and archive-encryption entry points require UTF-8
passwords of at most 64 KiB with a zxcvbn score of at least three. The desktop and
CLI share that policy. Existing vault unlock and archive decrypt deliberately
continue accepting their original factors, including weaker legacy passwords.
Software keyring and DPAPI-only fallbacks are rejected.

Each biometric HardwareSeal unseal performs a native authorization ceremony.
Factorseal then holds only the installation root and document-index key for its
independently bounded idle and absolute lease. Document DEKs and signing
capabilities are root-unwrapped into zeroizing memory only for an operation.
For new macOS 26+ vaults, this capability is an opaque Secure Enclave ML-DSA-65
reference; the private signing key stays in the enclave. Other platforms and
existing vaults retain software signing seeds.
Native cancellation, denial, unavailable UI, locked session,
and invalidated credentials remain distinct vault errors; unavailable hardware
and unsupported policy are distinct as well. None is treated as a prompt
success or silently downgraded.

## Cryptographic profile and FIPS status

Every persisted vault profile uses AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption,
SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-256 for digests and keyed identifiers, and FIPS 204
ML-DSA-65 for device signatures. The default profile uses Argon2id for
password-containing unlock groups because it is memory-hard. The opt-in FIPS
profile uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 instead. Its NIST-standardized symmetric,
password-derivation, and post-quantum algorithms are intended to make a future
validated provider and deployment boundary possible.

The current RustCrypto implementations have not been validated through CAVP or
CMVP, Factorseal has no FIPS 140-3 certificate, and algorithm selection alone
does not make a product FIPS compliant or validated. Argon2id is not a
FIPS-approved KDF and is therefore excluded from the FIPS profile. Deployment
status also depends on the exact TPM, operating-system module, device
configuration, build, entropy source, approved operating mode, and product boundary. Platform
biometric ceremonies may depend on classical algorithms and are not claimed to
be completely post-quantum certified.

## Authenticated transports

- Linux uses a mode-0600 Unix socket, `SO_PEERCRED`, same-UID enforcement, peer
  PID, and a digest of `/proc/<pid>/exe`. A peer that is being traced, or that
  was started with `LD_PRELOAD` or `LD_AUDIT` in its environment, is rejected
  before its executable is resolved.
- macOS uses a mode-0600 Unix socket, kernel peer credentials, peer PID, and an
  audit token, then binds the grant to the executable digest.
- Windows uses a local-only named pipe with a current-user/System/admin DACL,
  impersonates each client, verifies its immutable SID against the vault SID,
  and binds the grant to its PID-resolved executable digest.

Clients authenticate the connected server before sending any request bytes:
Unix clients require their own UID; Windows clients require their own SID as
both pipe-object owner and server-process identity. Windows opens use
identification-only security quality of service, not full impersonation.

Caller identity is never accepted from request JSON. Replacing or updating an
executable changes its digest and invalidates its grant. The digest is taken
from a descriptor opened once, so the path, size, and bytes always describe the
same image, and the peer's process start time is compared before and after
resolution, so a reused process ID cannot inherit another process's grant.

Pending project approvals are capped at 128 globally and 16 per authenticated
caller. A monotonic sliding minute permits at most 128 new approvals globally
and eight per caller, including approvals subsequently granted or denied.
Overload rejects new approvals without evicting existing ones. Repeating a
pending request returns its original identifier and expiry without refreshing
the approval UI. These are lease-local abuse controls, not isolation from a
same-user process that can run different executables or restart the vault.

Metadata and lock files reject final symlinks/reparse points and non-regular
files through the opened handle; Unix FIFO opens are nonblocking. Password,
metadata and lock inputs also reject hard links. Ancestor
path replacement and database sidecar handling still require
separate review. Windows root validation checks current-user ownership as well
as its protected DACL; child-file ACL inheritance also has a native regression
test, but two-account acceptance remains required.

Security events use fixed, saturating counters for authorization denial,
approval creation/decisions/limits, duplicate requests, malformed requests,
integrity failures, seal requests and failed memory protection. They contain
no names, fields, values, caller IDs or timestamps. Recording performs no
allocation or disk I/O; existing diagnostics snapshots include the aggregate
counters. These process-local events are operational evidence, not a durable
or tamper-proof audit log.

Every externally controlled parser family has an opt-in
[fuzz harness](fuzz/README.md). CI runs it on changes and daily, using synthetic
corpora, address sanitization and resource limits. This complements the native
and regression tests; it does not establish exhaustive malformed-input safety.

## Broad administrative and compatibility authority

A permission manager can inspect and change grants and use portable vault
export/import operations. Granting that capability therefore grants broad access
to durable entries; it is not a metadata-only role. First-party CLI/Desktop
executables receive this authority when initialized or reauthorized.

The Linux Secret Service collection is shared with applications on the user's
session bus. It does not provide separate per-application vault grants for each
keyring item. Its standard `plain` and legacy DH session algorithms are
compatibility transports, not FIPS or post-quantum protocol claims. Only use this
adapter where that session-wide trust is appropriate.

## Dependency maintenance

Pull requests and a daily scheduled workflow run the RustSec checker. Reported
vulnerabilities, yanked crates, new warnings, expired exceptions and obsolete
exceptions fail CI. Six transitive unmaintained-crate advisories currently have
exact package/version exceptions, with an owner, expiry and migration task in
[the dependency policy](security/dependency-exceptions.toml). These are accepted
maintenance risks, not resolved advisories; no vulnerability can use that
exception path. Desktop's direct notify dependency was upgraded, but compatible
GUI dependency parents still retain the six flagged crates. GUI libraries are
outside the separately built CLI key owner's dependency graph.

## Honest limitations

- Personal documents retain per-item Automerge histories inside their signed,
  encrypted snapshots. Unlike the value-free audit log, this includes old and
  deleted secret values, and newly enrolled readers currently receive that
  retained history. There is no password-history pruning or cryptographic
  erasure claim. The experimental `personal-sync` feature provides root-wrapped
  reader keys, authenticated encrypted change packets, durable publication and
  incoming merge/conflict handling through lease-bound host-management APIs.
  The optional `personal-sync-network` library adds a keyless iroh courier and
  controller-signed transport membership. Desktop now offers QR/ticket pairing
  and explicit code approval through inherited private worker pipes. Its courier
  continues while sealed if Desktop remains open; it starts after sync setup.
  Paired counts and reachability do not claim remote application. Mobile camera
  integration, peer application receipts, a conflict-resolution chooser,
  controller transfer and removal UI remain unimplemented.
  See the [implemented boundary](security/personal-sync-wire.md) for bounds,
  experimental cryptography, retained metadata, and integration requirements.

- An OR policy is bounded by its weakest unlock group. Biometric-only access
  has no independent recovery secret and can be lost after hardware reset,
  biometric enrollment changes, or platform-key invalidation.

- Native lifecycle monitors are implemented on all targets, but packaged
  artifacts remain development-only until suspend, shutdown, logout, and
  session-lock behavior passes on native machines.
- A signed local commit chain detects modified content, missing generations,
  divergent writers, and partial rollback when a newer protected head or
  commit remains, including a single document rewound while the global head is
  untouched. The chain is a tamper check, not an audit log: once it grows past
  a bound it is re-signed and compacted down to the current state of every
  document, and superseded generations are discarded. Every generation is
  encrypted under a fresh document key and each persisted snapshot contains
  only current records. Deletion is logical, not cryptographic erasure: retained
  wrapped keys and historical ciphertext in database remnants or backups can
  recover older values when the installation root is available. Checked WAL
  checkpoint/truncation reduces retention, but does not erase storage-device
  remnants, free pages, snapshots, backups or already exported copies.
  The value-free change history beside each document is as trustworthy as the
  installation root holder during a lease; it is a record for the user, not an
  audit log. It cannot detect rollback of the complete vault directory.
  Detecting that needs a checkpoint held
  outside the directory; the offline MVP does not claim whole-directory
  rollback detection. The [offline integrity profile](security/offline-integrity-profile.md)
  precisely defines this exclusion and the requirements for a future witness.
- The implemented `factorseal provider` endpoint uses SecretSpec's typed IPC
  protocol over private standard-I/O pipes and translates requests into the
  disposable, project-partitioned `secretspec-provider-cache` document kind
  through the native `VaultClient`. The
  endpoint executable—not the SecretSpec CLI or embedding application—is the
  authenticated vault principal. A grant therefore binds the provider
  executable, the project and folder SecretSpec declares, and the secret; any
  program that runs `secretspec` in that folder while the grant lasts is
  covered by it. The provider reports the executables that launched it
  (`secretspec` and the program that ran it) to the approval prompt, which
  shows them as not verified: they are read from the process table, where a
  process ID can be reused and a Windows process can be given any parent, so
  they never scope or authenticate a grant. Its IPC dependency is still pinned to an
  unpublished Git revision. For the default vault root, `init` publishes the
  user's provider claim and the agent refreshes it at startup; installed
  end-to-end conformance remains required on every target.
- Linux executable authentication depends on access to the ptrace-gated
  `/proc/<pid>/exe` link. The current systemd user unit therefore cannot use
  filesystem mount-namespace hardening. A verified IPC sandbox/application
  identity or different broker design is required to close that isolation gap.
- The Linux personal sync helper hard-requires fully enforced Landlock ABI 3
  (kernel 6.2 or later) and refuses to start otherwise; there is no weaker
  fallback confinement. Kernels older than that, including Debian 12 and
  Ubuntu 22.04 stock kernels, cannot run personal sync. The parser helper
  relies on seccomp only and has no such requirement.
- Executable identity is resolved after the connection is accepted, and no
  supported platform reports the image a peer had at connect time. A same-user
  process can therefore connect, queue its request, and only then execute a
  granted binary. Executable grants are defense in depth against the wrong
  program reaching the vault, not a boundary between same-user processes: a
  process that can execute a granted binary can also debug or preload it. The
  Linux transport rejects a peer that is under a tracer or carries a loader
  injection variable when it connects, which closes the direct debugger and
  `LD_PRELOAD` paths, but a same-user process can inject code and scrub those
  signals before it connects. The boundary the vault does enforce is the Unix
  user or Windows SID.
- Both CLI and Desktop disable Unix core files before acquiring secrets. Linux key-owning
  agent, initialization, destruction, reauthorization and isolated approval
  helpers additionally disable process dumpability (including piped core
  collectors). IPC-only clients stay inspectable for executable authentication.
  Native emergency termination exits without deliberately creating a core dump.
  Keys and retained password/value/IPC buffers use dedicated locked allocations
  with inaccessible guards and full-region wiping on release. Linux excludes those pages from dumps and wipes
  them in fork children. Windows suppresses WER heap collection while retaining
  existing flags. See [memory hardening](acceptance/memory-hardening.md) for
  allocation failures, deployment limits, test coverage, and buffers outside
  this protection. Privileged inspection, comprehensive wiping of library/OS
  copies, Windows LocalDumps/external dump policy, native platform verification,
  code signing/notarization and independent audit remain limitations.
- `destroy` removes local state, not every possible hardware authority. Linux
  and non-biometric Windows TPM envelopes have no per-label persistent key to
  revoke. Retained copies can remain usable on the original TPM with valid
  factors; one surviving OR unlock path suffices. No backup-revocation or
  cryptographic-erasure guarantee is made.
- Apple storage uses device-only, non-synchronizing Data Protection Keychain
  items with the requested access control. Opening a protector also requires
  successful transient Secure Enclave key creation. The probe does not itself
  wrap the vault root; native signed/entitled package tests must verify the
  Keychain policy and rejection of machines without a Secure Enclave.
- Deadlines are checked after queueing, before authorization and on completion;
  transport writes are bounded by the lease and known result/grant expiry.
  Bytes already released to an authorized client cannot be withdrawn. A native
  agent independently terminates if a wedged worker prevents timely teardown;
  library embedders do not opt into terminating their host process and must
  provide process isolation for a hard key-retention bound.
- Windows biometric groups encrypt a TPM sealed-data object under a Windows
  Hello platform-credential PRF output. Native acceptance must establish PRF
  support, TPM binding, timeout/cancellation behavior, the application-owned
  prompt window, and the supported Windows Hello prompt before the release
  gate can pass.
- Software ML-DSA-65 signing seeds are root-wrapped and exist in zeroizing
  vault memory only while signing. New macOS 26+ vaults instead use a
  non-exportable enclave key through a root-wrapped reference. Existing
  identities are not rotated on upgrade. The retained installation root still has
  authority to unwrap every local document during an active lease, so code
  execution in the unsealed process remains outside this protection.
- Hardware binding cannot prevent an already authorized or compromised client
  from exfiltrating a secret returned to it.
- Encrypted `.factorseal` archives provide portable backup and restore into a
  newly initialized hardware-bound vault. They require a separately retained
  archive passphrase and exclude device keys, application grants, history and
  disposable provider caches. Hardware loss still loses any data that was not
  exported beforehand; copying the native vault directory is not portable
  recovery. Archives are not automatically created or revoked by `destroy`.
- The bounded request-ID window is an idempotency guard against a client
  resubmitting a request, not a replay defense: the local transport is a
  peer-credentialed, owner-only socket or pipe with no intermediary to replay
  through.
- The embedded database is a pre-release Turso build and the sole durable
  store. Its crash consistency is trusted for the one-transaction commit
  path; the signed commit chain detects a torn or tampered result but cannot
  repair it.
